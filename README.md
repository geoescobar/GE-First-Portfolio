Hello! 

This is my portfolio! It was a roller coaster to make! I am very proud of the final resuts and am excited to add changes to it as the class progresses. In the paragraphs below is a brief summary of what to expect when going through it! 

I divided my portfolio into a variety of sections each containing different information. I started with a welcome page. On this page it had a header with links to my different sections and also contained an interactive hover welcome banner with a small description. 

The following section is an about me where I tell you a bit about myself. I am not the best at describing myself and always have issues filling these out but I think I did a good job. On thing I did really enjoy was making the image round and having the text to the left of it. 

Finally I have my work which contains stock images of my "projects" these. These are all live and link to my github. WHile none of this contains real projects it is a placeholder for when clicking on them to open something. 

I finally ended by adding my social and contact links at the bottom. They all open in seperate windows also.
